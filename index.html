		   		<p class="lead">This project aims to analyse the commercials and also their sub-parts. Another goal of it is to represent the messages which are not explicit and remain non-verbal but are transmitted through the advertising video. This will be done by applying certain computational tools. Based on the computational results will be created a knowledge graph which illustrates the structure behind the advertising strategy of Coca-Cola campaign. The last will make explicit the various approaches for creation of the following campaigns “Taste the feeling” and "Open the happiness". It will show the use of connotation, denotation as well as the power of structuralism of Saussure(signified, signifier) in the advertising field.</p>

		            <p>
		            The advertising strategy of Coca-Cola through the years has a few topics that are always tackled. This tendency is stable through the years and we could see it also in the main core of the idea behinf the ads 'Taste the feeling' and 'Open happiness'. </br>
		            The Coca-Cola product is presented within different aspects of our daily life and associated with a wide variety of actions, feelings and emotional states. So as to be able to connect it to any  daily situation. What is in the core is to promote the concept of having this carbonated drink as a companion in our everyday life.

	            	<h3 class="h05">Communication model</h3>  

		            <p>In the advertisement of Coca-Cola we are able to observe 2 ways of communication – verbal and non-verbal. By using them both  the target audience receives  more complex and multilayered messages. The non-verbal communication goes far beyond what is on the surface and what is obvious and well-known. It is trying to construct a concept, by employing the advantages of verbal and non-verbal communication so that the message that is sent to the customer is stronger combining text messages as well as visual representations.

		            <p>By taking into consideration the resuls that have been reached by applying a variety of tools, the most essential knowledge has been extracted that comes out of this case-study, so that it could be reused in similar case-scenarios. Coca-CoLOnthology will include information about the history of previous slogans, advertising campaigns, strategical concept and semiotics used in the advertising. All this will point out the layers from which consists a successful advertisement of Coca-Cola. The classes that are created in Coca-CoLOnthology by using Protégé, the ontology development environment for the Web, is shown via WebVowl.

	            	<h3 class="h05">Semiotics in Advertising</h3>

		            <p>Semiotics are frequently used in advertising as a means to transmit  company's message through the use of signs or symbols and their respective denotative and conotative meanings. A sign by its own can be better understood  in different ways as a signifier – its literal meaning, or as a symbol that points to something else. By applying the tools of the semiotics the advertisers are able to create not just positive attitude, but also loyalty towards a brand. This process requires long time and is being done by employing  repetition, combinations of symbols, bringing words, images and music together to create one whole completed concept, that the customer will associate with the single product and consequently with the brand.

We are interested in the root of the words and because of that <b>endings, plurals have been detached as to remain just the word root.</b></p>
		<p>After the execution, the 5 most frequent words, used through the years for Coca-cola slogans, are related to the following topics:</p>

		<img style="width:40% !important " src="slogans-history-five.png"></div>

	   	The various relations between Coca-Cola and the advertisements have been made explicit through the use of RDF graph  below:

   			<div class="about-profile-bg"></div>
				<div class="col-twelve">
				<p><h3>Verbal and non-verbal approach</h3></p>
		
				<p>In the ad <b>'Open happiness', the focus is put on the non-verbal communication</b> and the various activities and emotions. While in <b>'Taste the feeling' the approach combines verbal and non-verbal communication</b>. The scenes are enriched by slogans that emphasize the features of the product and the wide range of daily situations in which we consume it.</p>
				<p> In the advertising 'Taste the feeling' we could observe the verbal approach in the slogans appearing throughout the video. In all of them <b>lacks an essential part</b> for the construction of a basic phrase or a sentence - <b>a verb</b>. So that <b>the supposed activity or action is left to be imagined by the public.</b></p>
				<p>The other approach is the non-verbal communication which basically uses different kind of emotions, facial expressions, body signs and gestures in order to implement certain ideas and concepts. In the video, we are able to observe a wide range of different emotions as surprise, happiness, excitement, exhilaration, etc. Apart from that most of the people in it are smiling and are accompanied by others, which implies the idea of sharing something positive. 
				</p>
				<p>
				 In both ads we could see also people hugging each other, holding hands or trying to have some physical contact with the other person, which is a sign for sharing some positive feeling, being together doing a certain action, making it in a group. What is essential when extracting information from the scenes is to <b>observe a bit more abstractly</b> and see how they <b>represent a wide variety of our daily routines, situations and scenarious</b>. This makes us prone to believe that the <b>product is for everyone and for any kind of situation</b>
				<p><h5>Qualitative descriptive analysis</h5></p>
					<p> In the table below you could see a descriptive analysis of 6 scenes, part of the ad 'Taste the feeling', combining verbal and non-verbal communication.<b> The combination of both approaches emphasizes the message that is meant to be sent to the customers</b>. The essential about these scenes is that we have a few things to consider: our association with the text shown through the scene, as well as the <b>meaning of the scene and its relation with the slogan</b>. This provides <b>more options for interpretation</b>. The scenes from the video could be seen below the table.

The thing that makes impression is the <b>wide use of pronouns</b> in one case that is a <b>strategy for some personalization</b> and basically pointing out that this product is made exactly for you, for me, for us, etc. In the other case we could see a <b>concept line about some kind of emotion, feeling, that is pushing you to explore something new, promising that it will bring you happiness</b>. However, everything remains much more vague and is left to the consumer to decide the interpretation. The difference between these two campaigns that we could notice is that <b>one is more focused on addressing personal experience and the other leaves more space for interpretation.</b></p>

	 			<p style="color:white">In the video ad 'Taste the feeling' there is some text that is complimentary to the visual. The majority of the words are used twice in the inscriptions, and we are seeing an obvious repetition. One phrase finishes with a certain word and the consequent ones starts with the same one. This puts emphasis on the repeated words and pushes us to employ our imagination, creativity and past experiences in order to create our own concept starting from a few keywords.
				Most of the words imply the presence of more people. There is an implication that there is more than one person doing a certain activity, that what is being experienced is being shared.</p>

In the field of advertising and marketing when we talk about a beverage, <b>the two most exploited starting points are refreshment and taste</b>. This is why through the years Coca-Cola has used with great success slogans like 'Life Tastes Good', 'Enjoy Coca-Cola' and 'Coke Refreshes You Best'.</p>
		   
		   			<p>The ad <b>‘Open happiness’ has for its central idea happiness</b>, which is shown by any act that could bring a smile. However, <b>the link with the product itself remains a bit vague and not that clear</b>. While <b>‘Taste the feeling’ brings the focus directly on  the product</b>. ‘Open happiness’ puts the emphasis on brand’s image and values, while ‘Taste the feeling’ puts in a central role the product itself. The product is also being used as a means to communicate the functional and emotional aspects related to the brand by representing everyday moments with product consumption and the emotional changes and conditions.</p>

		            <p>
				
					In the food advertising the use of conceptual metaphors is quite extensive in order to provoke customers’ interest. By conceptualization of different aspects related to the product into various entites and objects, the marketing strategists present us one conceptual idea, not just a single product.
					We could find a conceptualization in the ad 'Open happiness', where the message to the customer is that drinking Coca-Cola makes you happy, it is a bridge towards happiness. Happiness that is a state interpretated and understood by anyone in different terms becomes captured in a simple bottle of Coca-Cola, that is the easiest way as promoted to us in order to obtain positive emotions.

		            <p>Ontological metaphors are used often in order to be interpreted as entity and are based on our past experience. In our case in the phrase “Taste the feeling”, we are able to interpret “feeling” as an entity, because it refers to a sequence of events that have the task to create this so called “feeling". The feeling itself involves different sensations and emotional states. In some people tasting Coca-Cola, might provoke hunger, a crave to drink even more of it, happiness, satisfaction, stimulation, etc. In the ad 'Taste the feeling' we are being presented with various slogans, pointing to different feeling and emotions, which are paving the way to reaching 'the feeling'at the end, which is like a culmination and a collective term for all of the emotions that drinking a bottle of Coke might trigger.</p>

		   		<h1>Concept and use of the sign</h1>  			
		   		
		   		<p class="lead">In the advertising campaigns we could find features of Saussure's structuralism as well as figures of connotation. By definition structuralism is a system in which each element in a group can only be understood by its relation to other elements as part of a larger structure. In its core is the study about conveying messages. Saussure's theory is based on the idea that each language is made up of signs. Furthermore, each sign is made up of two parts – signifier and signified. The signifier is the pointing finger, the word, the sound-image. It is in the interpretation of the signifier that meaning is created.</p>

				<p style="color:white !important">The signified is the concept, the meaning, the thing indicated by the signifier. 
				It doesn't need to be a 'real object' but is some referent to which the signifier refers.
				The thing signified is created in the perceiver and is internal to them. Whilst we share concepts, we do so via signifiers.
				Whilst the signifier is more stable, the signified varies between people and contexts.
				The signified does stabilize with habit, as the signifier cues thoughts and images.</p>

				<p style="color:white !important">
				In both ads the authors are trying to put the focus on the signified. They are creating <b>relations between a bottle of Coca-Cola as a bridge to happiness or as a symbol of series of positive emotions and feelings</b>. In 'Open happiness' we have 'happiness' is seen as something related and somehow connected to consuming Coca-Cola. In the ad 'Taste the feeling', the term 'feeling' is employed in its various meanings pushing the customer to build their own interpretation after being shown a number of various situations.<br> The idea is to associate the product not just with its obvious features as bringing refreshment and satisfying thirst, but <b>to look beyond</b> and to make us desire it <b>for its other characteristics</b> as shown in the ads - a means to meet new people, to make new friendships, etc.

				<p style="color:white !important">In regards to the different understanding and perception of the advertisement from the different aged groups, I am putting a link to a research, that shows how the young customers are mainly focused on the experience and the various emotions related with the product, associating it with their own experience.  They are much more interested to know what kind of emotion or feeling can the product bring them. These patterns are being represented by the signified part of the product.<br>
				At the same time the mature audience is focused more on the practical features and characteristics of the product that are being represented by the signifier. No matter that the video is designed in order to make us relate to the product with stories and events, the mature audience emphasizes more on the practical sides of the product as refreshing taste, boosting energy and power, satisfying thirst, etc.</p>

					In perceiving the verbal data the young people are prone to connect what they see as text message with the ongoing scene. The young audiece tend to relate the inscriptions with their personal experiences and stories belonging to their own circle of friends, relatives and lifestyle. 
					<br>
					In distinction the mature respondents find difficulties in providing perceived meanings as for them it is quite vague the connection between Coca-Cola and the inscriptions shown during the ad "Taste the feeling".

				<!--<p style="color:white !important"> In regards to the perception of the young audience of the non-verbal message, most of them highlighted the role of the fizzy drink in the daily life. Some of them even described it as some sort of a companion or a way for boosting the mood. However, there were also others who found difficulties in pointing out any relation to Coca-Cola as with what they see in the specific scene.
				<br>The older audience mostly focused on the refreshment characteristics of the carbonated drink, which is a typical feature. They did not tend to seek for deeper meanings. Some of them have the opinion that the images of the scenes do not fit to Coca-Cola and were not able to find out the intended messages by certain symbolic signs.
			</p> -->

				<p class="lead" style="margin-top: 50px; color:lightblue !important">
					To sum up, the people belonging to the mature age group focus their attention on the practical use of the product while the younger audience puts more attention on what kind of experience they could get by consuming the drink. The older group of consumers are concentrated on the practical side while the young respondents on the emotional and symbolic role of the product. Because of this we could conclude that advertisements focused on features of the product like taste and refreshment are more appropriate and better perceived by the mature public. While for the youth, it is important to be able to create various associations with their personal experience.

                   Chief Marketing Officer Marcos de Quinto, who unveiled the “one brand” approach at a media event in Paris, said the strategy extends the equity and iconic appeal of the world’s No. 1 beverage brand to Coca-Cola Light/Diet Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero and Coca-Cola Life. It also underscores the company’s commitment to choice, offering consumers whichever Coca-Cola suits their taste, lifestyle and diet – with or without calories, with or without caffeine.

                  <p>
                  We are reinforcing that Coca-Cola is for everybody,” de Quinto said. “Coca-Cola is one brand with different variants, all of which share the same values and visual iconography. People want their Coca-Cola in different ways, but whichever one they want, they want a Coca-Cola brand with great taste and refreshment.
